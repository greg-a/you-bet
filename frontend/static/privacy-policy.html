      fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services,

      for, as appropriate, username, name, email address, and password. Users
      may, however, visit our app anonymously. We will collect personal
      identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such
      information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally
      identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging
      in certain app-related activities.
    </p>

    <h2>Non-personal identification information</h2>

    <p>
